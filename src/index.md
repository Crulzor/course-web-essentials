## Lifelong learning

The technology domain in general is an ever changing and evolving domain. What you knew yesterday might not apply anymore, what you know today might not applicable tomorrow. Technology improves all the time. It is impossible to create a single course that covers it all. This course functions only as a **step** to more and other information. This course will provide a solid base to get some understanding in how everything works. Your goals or challenges will quickly surpass what we are able to bring you. Therefore it is important that you learn to gather the information you need for yourself. During the course many pointers to extra sources of learning or information will be provided. Add these sources to your toolbox in order to be successful in the future.

I encourage anyone to play, tinker, hack, experiment, try out new things... This is the easiest way to learn and understand things.
